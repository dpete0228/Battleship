# Overview

In this project, I developed a digital version of the classic Battleship strategy game using Python and the Arcade game framework. The game includes both Hotseat Mode (two players using the same computer) and Network Mode (two players connecting over LAN). My goal was to design a fully interactive, visually intuitive system that demonstrates clean architecture, event-driven programming, and reliable client-server networking.
